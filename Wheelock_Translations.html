<p>My girl does not love me. You must be strong, girl! Catallus is firm: the poet does not love the girl; he does not praise the form of the girl; he does not give roses to the girl, et he does not kiss the girl! My anger is great! I am tough, my girl - but without you, I am not strong.</p>

<p>Farmers often praise both the life and fortune of the sailor; the sailor often praises the great fortune and life of the poet; and the poet praises the life and fields of the farmer. Without philosophy, avaricious men always thinks about money: he has much money, but much money can’t satisfy the man of avarice.</p>

<h2 id="the-rarity-of-friendship">The Rarity of Friendship</h2>
<p>Few men have true friends, et few men are worthy. True friendshup est splendid, et all friendship is remarkable. Many foolish men always think of money, few men think about friends; but they err: we are able to be strong without much coin, but without friendship we are not strong, and life is nothing.</p>
